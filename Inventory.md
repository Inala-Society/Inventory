# Forks

### Small forks

* Number : 2

![GardenFork](https://inalasite.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/image3.jpg?w=113)

* Condition : Plastic fork is in relatively good condition although plastic is
brittle from sun exposure. Metal fork is slightly bent out of shape.
* Description : Plastic fork is of little use for digging through hard soil, and even
metal fork is prone to bending and might break in rocky soil.


### Trowels

* Number: 2

  ![image12](https://inalasite.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/image12.jpg?w=113)

* Condition : the handle is slightly bend in relation to the spade
attachment.

* Description : the metal of the spade is soft and bends easily,
while the spade can be used for turning prepared beds it is unsuitable
for digging through rocky soil.

### Shovels

Number: 2

![spade2](https://inalasite.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/image8.jpg?w=113)

* Condition: no sign of breakage on either shovel, despite heavy
use. However, shovels have been put under serious strain so metal may be
more fatigued than is apparent. [ ]{.c7 .c2}

* Decription : The lack of a handle on the second shovel makes it quite awkward to
use, often resulting in blisters.

## Hose and attachments

### Hose

* Number : 1

* No picture yet

* Condition : Not tearing/breakage as of yet, storing the hose in the bin leads to it
becoming very hot, which in summer may lead to a degree of melting in
the hose plastic, this has not yet been a problem.

* Description and commentary : Hose is not quite long enough to easily reach the entire garden which
leads to uneven watering. It is also prone to kinking leading to
pressure build up and reduced flow which slows down the watering
process. A better storage solution may help to combat this problem,
possible a circular real to wrap hose around.

### Sprinkles attachments

 * Number : 2

![image5](https://inalasite.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/image5.jpg?w=225)

* Condition : Appear to be in good condition

* Description and commentary : Have yet to be tested to see if they work, not sure of the function of
the orange attachment. While these attachments may prove an asset at some point they are of
little use for the hands on watering which is currently required at the
West campus food garden.

### Spraying attachments

* Number : 2


![image7](https://inalasite.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/image7.jpg?w=225)
* Condition: Still in perfect working condition
* Description and commentary : Both Help to equalise water flow (as water pressure from tap tends to
fluctuate), but reduces water flow slightly making it hard to reach
areas of the garden further up, (again this relates to the hosepipe
length problem) .The wide tip attachment is more useful as it creates a more gently
spray so is less likely to damage and displace plants.

### Tap attachments

## Rakes

* Number : 2

![image9](https://inalasite.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/image9.jpg?w=225)

### Wheelbarrow

![wheelbarrow1](https://inalasite.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/image11.jpg?w=225)

* Condition : metal of handles and frame slightly rusted, and seems
slightly unbalanced especially when carrying heavy loads, however still
rolls relatively easily.

## Pots

Large rectangular pots:

* Number : 6

![image6](https://inalasite.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/image6.jpg?w=225)
* Condition : Plastic is relatively strong, and has of yet
undergone very little wear.

* Description : pots are large enough to usefully grow several
vegetable crops, (herbs, smaller brassica varieties etc ) however they
have no holes in the bottom for drainage, which is problematic. Ideally
holes will be drilled in at a later stage.

### Bucket

* Number

![image4](https://inalasite.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/image4.jpg?w=225)

Condition: plastic is very scuffed but does not appear to be
broken.

Description and commentary

Relatively small and without drainage so not ideal for planting in, but
useful as an intermediary when removing stones and other undesirables
from the garden.

### Large Seedling trays (4 x 6)

Number: 12

![image10](https://inalasite.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/image10.jpg?w=225)

* Description : Plastic relatively strong and flexible no breakage has yet occurred.

* Source : scavenged from Wits dump.
